# Dog wiki
To solve the problem of lack of information sources about dogs, we have developed a mobile application or website with the goal of providing detailed and reliable information about every aspect of similar dog breeds. Our app is not simply a database of dog breeds, but also a useful and easily accessible resource for pet lovers.

One of the main features of the app is the dog breed list, where users can learn about the most popular and rare dog breeds. Each breed is presented in a clear and attractive manner, accompanied by images and brief information about the origin, history, and distinguishing characteristics of each breed.
