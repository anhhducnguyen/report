# Building Sales Software for Mini Supermarket

The project `Mini supermarket management software` is a software development project, with the purpose of building an employee, product, and order management system for mini supermarkets. The system will calculate costs based on the number of products that have been purchased, and provide management, reporting and statistics functions. In order for users to have a good experience when using it, it needs to be tested before being used more widely.
